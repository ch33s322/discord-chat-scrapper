WW is literally the opposite where personality oozes from every pour and facet of the game and it's protagonist. I think however, in many ways MM does a wonderful job of showing us Link's personality and how he's dealt with all of the stuff from OOT AND being a kid again. I also think his interactions as link-ified versions of dead characters and how grief is processed by loved ones is wonderful. The things Link does to both try and help but achieve the goal is quite fascinating to me.
