[266, 1, 'If it’s a product at all, art is a luxury product. There’s nothing wrong with making money off of art (I guess 😑) but feeling entitled to do so is silly. If it isn’t selling then find a buyer. If no one wants it then that’s fine. Now the artist has to decide if the creation is more important than their comfort / lively hood / life. They can choose any of those things virtuously. They can’t bitch and moan to me about no one giving them money to spend all their time doing only the shit they want to do.', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1327027103857770600']
