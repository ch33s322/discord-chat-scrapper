I am referring to the logical and mechanical source of all things; a single focal point on which all of existence spins. So that excludes most modern religions due to their having many or no gods. \n\nBeyond that; I have read quite a lot within Taoism, mysticism, and Greek philosophy as well as some Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism.  All of which are looking for god in their own ways. And it seems to me that Christ is who the best parts of these philosophies/religions point to.\n\nTo respond to your more recent point: \n\nI don’t believe that a human is truly capable of unconditional love. But that love which can be expressed is done so through god. God is love, in the most literal sense. Any love that is expressed is him and [is expressed] through him.
