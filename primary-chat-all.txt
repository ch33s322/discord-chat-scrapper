But it seems like maybe the “master hand” they fought may have been a puppet for a bigger threat?\nMovie two: the subspace army returns, with some of the individual smash bros’ villains at their head, Ganondorf, who keeps backstabbing ppl, at their head, and king dedede seemingly not following the higher ups’ actual orders for some reason. The hero lineup expands to include characters that maybe got cut out of the first movie despite being regulars in the games, but still characters that make sense in a multiverse action film. This one ends in a cliffhanger. The subspace cannon fires, ripping reality apart, and Tabuu is revealed as the true villain behind subspace, stabbing Ganondorf in the back before he could do it to him, and incapacitating most, if not all of the core heroes.\nMovie three: the characters that had the most contact with dedede in movie 2 wake up. Turns out he was helping all along. The handful of these characters, and some of the weirder smash characters all join up, slowly reassemble the heroes and villains to team up against Tabuu and fix the world he destroyed \n\nPlus you could always pull from world of light and stretch this cinematic universe out into another couple phases if u wanted as well', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/657566119070138370/1171695078629187594']

There was also a failure in the pedestrian not anticipating this and being careful, and the driver/car going at such a speed that they will kill someone.\n\nAlmost all driving involves reducing the likelihood that anything dangerous, let alone lethal, occurs.
