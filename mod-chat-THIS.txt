(At least for the group you are wanting back around) we really did not have large groups around unless they were playing a common game together.

The last few times we have had enough people on to consider games like that did not agree an a game and it kinda just, didn\'t happen.\n\nThere are still small pockets of the group getting together for games. But I know for me, I don\'t see a point in taking up a voice chat lobby when I am playing a game with 1 or 2 others, that most people don\'t have.\n\nThe other problem I see is that some of the key instigators that brought the group together in the first place, are really busy right now and have not had the time to pester people to get on.
