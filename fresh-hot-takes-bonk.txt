[3289, 1, 'I wish I liked fighting games, but I just can\'t stand them. So much learning for something that my disability will likely dictate that I am always going to be at the bottom tier at. It\'s also why I gravitate towards single-player or free-form games like Mincraft or Jedi. Also why I\'m a huge advocate of difficulty settings in games. I still can\'t play Souls or Competative Halo games as much as I would like to due to their parry/dodge responses times being just too short. I can\'t engage my brain and my fingers fast enough to see and respond to many things in Jedi on normal/easy so I know Souls games are out.\n\nAnyway not-so-hot-take every game should have a difficulty slider as an accessibility feature irrespective of the "Artistic Intention". It can be as important as a colorblind mode or captions for many players. Any game that doesn\'t have it or requires Online Play Only, should really be challenged in how to make their game accessible (heroes like Rein in OW I would argue actually do this really well)', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1166074553924079696']
