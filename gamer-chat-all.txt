Additionally, I don\'t like that they don\'t articulate why they set their goal where they did, is that from a quote for getting tooling made and production started? Did they add leeway? Is a portion of it going towards paying the founding team? Moreover, they insist that they will produce the mugs in Europe which is usually the most expensive continent for manufacturing, enough so that I\'m not sure they could even begin to recoup costs at that price point.

[4563, 1, 'Finally watched it.\nI don’t think I agree it’s the best direct I’ve seen? A lot of it was DLC and remakes. The most exciting things for me were the Peach game (buried in between two Mario universe remasters) and pikmin 1+2 HD dropping on eshop. So. A game we know nothing about and 2 remasters they didn’t even show off. \n\nPikmin 4 trailer better explains stuff we all kinda already knew about but doesn’t answer if challenge mode exists or what the gameplay loop of story mode will actually be? Like. What’s actually the purpose of the night segments? If tech based treasures fix the rescue ship, why are fruits also treasures? A lot we still don’t know but i guess the discovery will be part of the joy of the game. \n\nI do think this direct did way better than usual with the smaller segments. Showed off a lot of smaller studios and creative ideas. The 3D platformer from the sonic mania team. The pigeon rhythm game. Vampire survivors. This direct makes it clear that Switch has games out the wazoo even if some of them are weird and from studios you never fuckin heard of before. \n\nAnd the cherry on top is a game that, while it looks gimmicky and silly, shows that Nintendo isn’t afraid to experiment and get creative with 2D Mario, a subseries that earned a reputation for being stale and formulaic. This feels like the weird sensibilities of Mario maker got injected into a main series title and it’s delightful to see, even if it’s not my cup of tea.', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/880589042205474826/1121235938325045268']
