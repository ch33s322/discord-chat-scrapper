[5131, 1, 'It’s hard to find / phrase a perfect all-encompassing definition for a thing that is essentially a set of established societal ideas and behaviors. \n\nA simple distinction though is that positive masculinity is usually more related to someone’s own gender identity and expression, while unhealthy masculinity is controlling and stifling a man’s ability to self-express, and insisting he exist in a specific place in a patriarchal hierarchy. Unhealthy masculinity is not about you feeling strong, comfortable or confident **in yourself** as a man, but pushing you to achieve power and authority **over others.**', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1077258483931562074']
[5133, 1, "Great question. I'll take a shot at (mostly the second half of) it here.\n\nToxic masculinity is when those negative/harmful behaviors are because of gender-enforced conditioning--be it parental nurture or cultural expectations. One popular example of this is the notion that men cat-calling women is positive. Many guys who cat-call think the women they target should be grateful to them for doing so. This is similar to how Trump infamously said that famous men can simply kiss women without asking and grope them. He claimed that women let famous people do that and asserted that they like it.\n\nA far more relatable example is when adults (men or women) tell boys that they're not allowed to cry yet allow girls to cry without scolding them. This enforces aspects of toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity neither allows men to express their emotions nor to seek help. Toxic masculinity says that men must be self-reliant, must be the provider in a relationship, etc. There are still people who look down on men that can cook/clean because those are women's jobs. Male chauvinism is always toxic masculinity, but toxic masculinity isn't always male chauvinism.\n\nLikewise, toxic femininity would be telling women that they can't work a job and aren't fulfilling their sacred duty as women unless they bear/rear a child. It's also telling a woman that she must dress a certain way or do certain things to please and serve her husband.", 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1077042516991418509']

In my ideal world, in order to get to that point, the system would have to be utterly broken and non functioning.\n\nIdeally, these basic services are what they sound like: "Basic" (the only one that\'s not is Healthcare because every medical need should be met irrespective of cost). I don\'t want to live in a one bedroom shoebox with a desk, closet, and bed, but I can. If I want a better life I can better myself, I can pull myself up, I can do that with or (eventually without the system).

[12696, 2, 'While I love the concept of the "Cube Rule" of food identification, I have a few major issues with the terms chosen by the OP.\n\n1) While quiche is all well and good, this category would serve the culinary world much better by calling that shape a pie. A quiche is just an egg pie. You can have a fruit pie, meat pie, dessert pie, etc. Pies can have a thin layer on top without them converting to the category I will complain about next.\n\n2) Instead of calzone, which is really just a pizza (toast) folded over onto itself, we should call this either ravioli or a dumpling. Dumplings are more widely recognized and used in many more cultures; however, some people might argue that a dumpling with no filling (e.g. gnocchi) should not count for this category. To such people, I point to toast, which does not require any topping to be toast.\n\n3) This is my most grievous complaint. Only about a third of sushi has the shape OP labeled as sushi. Makizushi is a type of sushi made by rolling ingredients with a seaweed wrapper, but it\'s neither the most common nor the most famous type of sushi. It\'s just the one commonly used to convince people to try sushi for the first time (i.e. California Rolls). Nigiri is the most common and popular type of sushi. Nigiri is toast. The category labeled "sushi" by the OP should instead, I propose and insist, be called burrito. Makizushi is just a sushi burrito that\'s been cut into slices. Same goes for pinwheel sandwiches.

They're just doing it to troll social media. It's the same reason that Chick-fil-A had a record year when we boycotted it.\n(2) It's been non-stop the #1 game on Twitch because people want to see what the controversy is about AND (3) because streamers are refusing to stream during Twitch's Hogwarts Legacy ad campaign, which means that the only people streaming are streaming Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nFinally, (4) with HP specifically, it's so popular in Asia and other places where people don't speak English that the boycott only had the potential to marginally decrease sales. Of course, it had the opposite effect instead.\n\nBoycotts of large, established entities don't work in our contrarian society.\n\nMy follow-up lukewarm (in comparison) take: If we just quietly didn't buy the game, it wouldn't have done near as well. Everyone who cares about Trans people knows JK Rowling is a Transphobe. Telling people to boycott helps 0 people decide to boycott with you. They already weren't going to buy it.
