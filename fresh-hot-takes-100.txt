Leaf Green and Fire Red took it from an feeling and looking like an OG Gameboy game to a being a full-fledged GBA game. Heart Gold/Soul Silver took GBA games and nearly doubled the content with the DS's improved storage space. With BDSP, they did update the graphics significantly, but they took the best part of the game (Pokemon Contests), removed the effects of and contest typings of moves, replaced the crowd-pleasing feature with a very simplistic rhythm game, and completely got rid of any reason to ever use poffins (I beat the Beauty, Coolness, Cuteness, Cleverness, and Toughness contests all with the same Pokemon--my  Gastrodon--who didn't do any special training and for who I didn't bother teaching new moves to). The contests no longer have any strategy. Pokemon Contests were supposed to be a seperate path for Pokemon who don't like/aren't good at combat. It's the reason I was excited for BDSP! I wanted to live my pacifistic Pokemon dream and be the Pokemon Contest Champion. \n\nThey didn't want to bother programing the contest system a second time, so they just replaced it with shovelware.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right that there are highly-vocal toxic Pokémon fans.

[3288, 2, 'Souls games arnt about reaction time, they’re rhythm games. You’re memorizing *when* to press the dodge button, it’s not about how fast can the player react. Most boss moves are highly telegraphed and are designed so that after you get familiar with their moves you can see them well in advance. I personally believe anyone can beat a souls game with enough practice. Obviously different people will learn at different rates, and previous souls game experience effects that. but in my personal experience I’ve watched multiple people who where objectively trash at souls games become better throughout their first play through, when they finally finish and decide to restart, the game is easy because they’ve already memorized the timings for all the bosses. My first run through of ds3 took like 70 hours, which is NOT short. My second run through took 10 hours, and my third took 5. I have completed that game 7 times now and it poses no challenge, but with elden ring I’m still on my first play through. Everything is new and I’m getting shit on. That’s just the way the game goes.\n\nElden ring also really increases the accessibility for new comers to the franchise imo because if you get stuck on a boss you can just explore in a different direction for awhile, and acquire a bunch of items and levels. You might find that when you come back to the boss you were stuck on that the new weapons you found or all the extra levels you got made the boss just that little bit easier to finally beat them.\n\nAnd worse come to worse, all souls games have multiplayer so if you have a friend who is willing, you can team up for harder bosses. And even though the boss gets a huge health boost for each additional player, being able to switch the bosses Agro can take the pressure off long enough for even the most fragile characters to survive that little bit longer to defeat the boss.\n\n\n\nFighting games genuinely do have that problem because reaction time is way more important when you’re fighting a human player, who is unpredictable, and often the moves are much much faster.\nSo I absolutely agree that anyone who has a bad reaction time will probably enjoy the game less.\n\nBut yeah contrary to popular belief dark souls is in fact not the definition of bad game design, it’s just a guitar hero wearing the skin of Skyrim', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1166110439793504418']

[8068, 2, 'I have mixed feelings on this. (but also for context idk how Genshin\'s specific monetization works) I agree that it\'s infantilizing to just say people have no self control. And it should be an obvious fact that every game with monetization (which is almost all of them now, because it works well for making money) will try to psychologically guide people to spend more.\nBut there\'s definitely a line that can be crossed where a game (or other business) is super predatory in how they try to incentivize you to give them money. Payday and title loans are super fucking predatory on people who don\'t have much money, and I wish they were illegal. Even though their customers are voluntarily participating in it, they\'re so misled and forced to overpay that it\'s just not a fair system. I don\'t agree with a hyperlibertarian stance that would say "well, you signed it, so it\'s 100% your fault and the company has no part in being shitty here".\nIf a large number of people are maxing out credit cards to play a game, it\'s a good sign that the game has crossed that line between decent monetization and tricking people into paying you too much. On the other hand, a few people who can afford it paying a lot, or the occasional person with an overspending problem going overboard, doesn\'t necessarily show predatory behavior IMO. Some other things in life also have a line that is sometimes crossed, like gambling. They toe a fine line between things like putting gambling problem help lines out there, and making gambling more addictive, and not taking credit cards for payment because it encourages overspending/debt, and not advertising to minors or allowing them to play as they\'re especially vulnerable.

Whereas women tend to rate men using several aspects, some less subjective than looks.
