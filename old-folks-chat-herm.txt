[841, 1, 'From what I read he only made a single $15 dollar donation to a democrat PAC on Jan 6 in 2021, seems like a bizarre time to donate. This is speculation but reports have been vague about what type of gun he used and whether he owned it. Most reports are calling it an "AR-15 style rifle", which makes me think it was custom built, which would likely align him more rightward. The shot was also from ~300 ft away which is not easy if you were not practicing with that rifle at that range.', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/896903926580932608/1262180336599826432']
