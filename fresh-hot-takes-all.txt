[1459, 1, '*Re:Definition of critical*\nSo, I guess what I meant by "Im the opposite of Hypercritical of Lyrics" is not that I dont assess, but that I actively seek out lyrics that go against what would slide under my assessment in some way. Lyrics that catch you off guard and force you to listen to them. Like I said I think a lot of this instinct comes from listening to music thats either comedic or story-driven. If its not challenging me in some way, it appeals to me less. \n\nBefore I continue, for clarity, "Look What You Made Me Do" isnt really about treating people as disposable. Thats more "Blank Space". But thats whatever. \n\n*Re: Look what you made me do "if the song itself does not make it clear that this presentation is partially tongue in cheek, if you have to go to like a website or watch an interview to get that context, the song itself is just the glorification of it"*\nI think in this instance the lyrics honestly do make that clear? \nShe talks about the world being able to move on, but how she\'s trapped in her own thoughts of karma and revenge. How the "Old Taylor" is dead. And the chorus itself repeats, over and over, that despite the language of victimization, she is doing this to herself. "Look what you made *me* do". \nMetaknowledge surrounding the song does also support the idea that its a character though. In the music video, Taylor is murdering her past selves, secluding herself on a throne surrounded by shadow and void. And then this dark version of Taylor is itself washed away at the start of the music video that debuted with her following album. \nAgain, I personally dont pay attention to interviews or anything like that. But as you said, her intention is not more important than what the text actually says. \n\n*RE: Underlying premise*\nI think I agree with your general idea here, but not necessarily that everything must be absorbed or rejected in some way. I think personally, my consumption of art is less binary than that. I specifically dont think that failing to reject an idea is how propaganda works. I think effective propaganda is subtler than that. But if you disagree with that idk if i can explain what i mean by that.  Idk if I can explain my thoughts on this very well atm tho.

Functional: people get horny and its actually healthy and fine for people who dont have partners to get off sometimes. Like its gross to talk about it that way but you brought it up. Artistic: we literally hang art that was thought of as inappropriate and pornographic in its time in museums. The human form is inherently beatiful. Rendering images of nudity can be art and often is considered art. And seeking to throw out things that may be "art" because they are "porn" is an inherently puritanical and fascist position, imo. \n\n"Yet we know from the industry and the population they sell to, it is more likely to end up being a negative for them as well." unless Im mistaken in what youre referring to, this is a problem with the porn industry, not the content itself, and has only become less of the case the more independently controlled the industry becomes.

I tell people all the time that it\'s a memorization game and that\'s what I think Dakota meant by calling it a rhythm game earlier.\n\n>  I will have not experienced the art in the way everyone else was able to even though I put in the work.\n\nEven if they added a difficulty slider this would still be true.\n\n> the solution is already there for me to experience the art in the same way as everyone else?\n\nThat\'s not what a difficulty slider would do\n\n>  It seems to me like "Artistic Integrity" is a lazy excuse to justify gatekeeping\n\nI expect that\'s true in some places. Dark souls specifically has a history of a pretty toxic fanbase. And, to be clear, I don\'t know that I think dark souls is a game that would be harmed by difficulty settings. DS2 famously had pretty great difficulty settings, it just went under the radar because no one liked the game overall. And I played both DS1 and DS3 on the "easy setting" by playing a sorcerer. Dakota was talking about how long it took him to beat Elden Ring. And that\'s because he was trying to beat the game the traditional way (big muscle, big stick). But I\'m just there for the lore so I played a sorcerer and smoked the game in under a month after he\'d been pounding away at it for over a year.', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1166352052784467968']

Ofc the people who think aryans are the descendants of Norse gods will agree that there’s record of space people. Of course if someone believes that Jews control the government and the media and the internet, they’re not gonna believe those sources when they say aliens aren’t real. It’s why MTG has said the Jews have a space laser on the floor of congress that time. The alien believers and the “Jews control the world” people ARE THE SAME GROUP. I’m sure there’s individual alien believers who are chill.

He believed we’d make it through the uncertainty of his time and the destructive wars of the future. But that we wouldn’t do so without hope. And in that sense, while grappling with the concept of futility is certainly not without value, I find it much more valuable to engage with media that subverts that narrative. \nThe test is unwinnable bc it’s programmed that way. Kirk’s solution is out of the box and refusing to engage with the test on its own terms. It’s creative by necessity. And I have a hard time seeing truly futile situations in media as anything but uncreative. (Again, Not that something like dark souls is without value) \nBc sure.

[8050, 1, "A big difference comes in that Genshin does NOT have any competitive play. The only multiplayer features are cooperative. I used to play a competitive F2P game: SEGA Heroes. That game *was* predatory. It had intentional power creep, meaning that newly released characters were intended to be stronger than previously released characters. I was in one of the top guilds in that game because I had started playing on day 1 and was max level (from playing every day). However, I couldn't get new characters easily. I wanted to stay in that guild, but getting new characters outside of a less than 1% chance (probably more like .001%) required spending money. I spent $40 on a single character one day (as a b-day gift to myself) in order to keep up with the meta as much as possible. Thankfully, that guild eventually decided to split in half--whales and non-whales. Competitive mobiles games *are* often predatory in nature because many of them are F2P but pay-to-win. There are exceptions like the ones made by Riot games (everything you need to win is obtainable easily by F2P--only cosmetic things cost money).\n\nWith non-competitive F2P, you have no outside motivators for buying things. Genshin does have a gacha mechanic for unlocking playable characters, but you get a decent number of free pulls every week just by playing. I will add a disclaimer: once someone spends money on a game, it's easy for them to get sucked in to spending money on the game again. But Genshin (from what I can tell so far) does not have many incentives to spend money except for bragging rights by getting something before most other people.

We can't give everyone free help, because some people I don't think deserve free help will get the free help.\n\n2. But how could we possibly afford to give people x help?\n\nFor the 1st point. If we're talking just about the things Joe listed (Shelter, food, water, electricity, Healthcare, education, child care), then I think you should have these as rights. I couldn't care less if some people take advantage of them, because it would raise the quality of life for everybody. Besides, we as a country already over-produce most consumer products. Every year craploads of brand new cars get dumped in landfills when they go unsold, more houses/dwellings sit empty than there are homeless people, there is so much food waste. We've also made leaps and bounds in terms of automation. We see robots and software taking jobs as a bad thing, but only because we don't have these universal rights. We could all stand to work a little less and have a little more.\n\nFor point 2, we’re the United States of America. We have enough wealth/economic power to put rocket boosters on Hawaii, launch it into the sun, and build a stronger and faster Hawaii in its place. The fact that most of that economic power is in the hands of a few corporations is something that can be fixed with policy. Taxes on the wealthy have been dropping every decade since WWII. I don’t have the perfect economic prescription for what percentages of what should be taxed. I’m just saying the wealth is there, and it could be utilized much better for the good of everyone.\n\nThe other thing to consider is we can look to Europe and see good implementations of pretty much everything Joe mentioned in one country or another. The main thing holding us back isn't a lack of resources or some people living off of government benefits.

The "racial attributes" that people are complaining about are split largely by race but it\'s a correlation not causation. The elven norms are elven norms because the elves had their own distinct nations, society, and culture. It\'s cultural norms that happen to coincide with race the same way the Maya were so distinct from the Spanish.\n\nSeems to me the complaints are based on smooth brain DMs (not big brain like me) who didn\'t think of a way to make this make sense or use wizards way and decided it was wizards fault', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/939328935030849576']

So, the average person: They generally agree that some kind of code is good but pretty consistently break the code and have a rational for doing so. 50/50, neutral. \n\nThe good evil dichotomy is a much more caustic discussion. But only, I think, because people don\'t like grappling with the idea that their baby is evil and try to rationalize instead. The only consistent metric I\'ve found for setting a character on this line is, "does the character make selfish choices or altruistic choices". There are dozens of arguments about this online but they\'re all so incoherent I honestly can\'t articulate one to you (if you\'ve got one please let me know). \nThe average person: almost exclusively makes selfish choices. Often they imagine being altruistic and tell themselves that if they had the opportunity they would do the big "jump in front of a bullet" move. But, day to day? It\'s, "what do I get out of this?".

[14604, 1, 'yeah i disagree with the meme, and ive had a lot of debates with my professors and teachers about this topic. Nuclear power is very efficient and has the power to be incredibly useful to humanity, the problem is, humanity is fucking stupid as shit and will find a way to fuck it up an do irreversible damage to the environment (in addition to unpredictable natural disasters hitting nuclear power plants, especially because we will continue to have worse and worse natural disasters in the future because of how bad we\'ve already fucked up the environment as a species). And governments tend to care more about their image than the damage they cause so historically they have a tendency to *attempt* cover up an accident instead of taking responsibility and trying to fix it asap. but im one of those *environmentalists* this meme is attempting to make fun of lol. And its not just about the number of deaths, radiation pollution and poisoning is no fucking joke, take the fukishima nuclear disaster for example, which is still an ongoing problem a whole decade later. I think its too simplistic to just ignore all the potential danger to this planet and people by only focusing on the benefits. Of course there are benefits, its just that the potential for disasters to happen and just *how much* damage they can cause to the world in the rare event it does, isnt worth it.

I can\'t speak to your experience playing that game, so while I understand how the comparison is relevant, I dont think you saying "this other game is similar, but provides more variety" really disproves anything the rest of us are saying. \nBotW DOES have a lack of variety. The enemy types get old QUICK. And 5 of the bosses are all visually the same as each other. (Im not sure how you get the total of 8 though? Are you counting Lynels and Hinoxes all as one each? Because they dont actually all have the same attack patterns as each other, just similarities) \nBut even so, not ALL the quests can be described the way you do here?\nPlus there\'s stuff that you can do that can\'t be qualified on this list. You left out the Dragons. Fairy fountains, different varieties of weapons, shields, bows, clothes, food just as examples of things you choose NOT to list for some reason?\nYou dont even list that there\'s 7 dungeons (if you count DLC), and yeah 5 of them are visually identical, but they\'re also more fun to play through than the dungeons in most other Zeldas. Hyrule Castle especially. \nYeah the game gets repetitive. A LOT of whats in the game is similar to a lot of what else is in the game, but that lets you build a kind of routine. It lets you develop pattern recognition and develop new strategies to deal with familiar, but increasingly difficult foes as you progress. And it makes the moments that ARE unique, like Eventide, or freeing Naydra so powerful and magical. The game lulls you into a sense of monotony but then it frequently breaks those patterns. \nThe thing is, even if you IGNORE Koroks COMPLETELY, everything Lenk and I said about the environment subtly guiding you to new challenges is still true, and its still full of rewards and things to do that make walking through that world worthwhile.', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/804150813731455018']

[2251, 2, 'This is healthy dialog. The behavior I have seen a lot (and part of what I\'m writing about in my essay which is why it\'s on my mind), is when someone says "Hey let\'s watch a movie!" The other person agrees and they discuss what to watch. One person says: "I really like or I\'ve been meaning to check out x movie because of xyz reson" the other person without even **engaging in dialog** (this part is key because as Wasabi pointed out, this is the part that can be an interesting and productive dialog), says something lime "That movie is trash" "I\'ve heard that that movie is trash" "I don\'t want to waste my time with that movie because xyz critic says it was bad" which can turn into questions like "Why do you even like that movie?" "You don\'t even have taste" "How about we watch a good movie instead".\n\nThis toxic mindset works in reverse too where the person talks up their movies and tastes above someone else\'s. Not because they love this thing, but because "the critics said this or because this is a good movie and isn\'t trash".\n\nMy main point is that it\'s really easy to put out bad criticism of media which can be personal. A great example is I have absolutely no desire to watch Avatar. I don\'t hate the movie, but I\'ve never gotten the hype and Cameron bores me as a director. However, if someone wanted to watch that movie, why would I put them down for that?\n\nI think there is this sense of both superiority, smugness, and righteousness when it comes to media that has always baffled me.

[2613, 2, 'Okay. \n\nUnless more recent episodes are way more insane than the ones Ive seen, everything in Bluey is super mundane. Pretty much every character should either be scaled to a perfectly ordinary child or parent in every stat. With a few big exceptions. \n\nI think there is enough evidence in the series to conclude that Bluey is *the best* at making up games. And the Toymaker cannot refuse an offer of a game nor cheat its rules. Even *if* she never truly outsmarted him, (the ways the Doctor has beaten him come down to fairly simple tricks, so big if imo) Bluey could trap the Toymaker in an endless game with no real win condition. Bc Bluey can commit to a bit seemingly endlessly. IF she gets bored she can make up a different game and start playing that without it stopping her from continuing the first game. If she\'s stopped by Bedtime she can continue the game in her dreams bc she\'s a lucid dreamer and dreamwalker. Thats canon I think.\nEventually Bluey would wear him down, like Doctor Strange against Dormamu. It doesnt matter if the godlike Toymaker is technically more powerful, Bluey excels in the only stats that would really matter in a game against the Toymaker. \n\nbut she still loses in a fight against anything stronger than an average child that *isn\'t* a demon compelled to play games against anyone who challenges them. \n\nBandit could probably win "best fictional dad" against *most* other fictional dads but thats subjective and Im sure there\'s dads that beat him bc Bandit\'s still a flawed character himself, thats part of the point of him. And hes definitely not the strongest fictional dad by a long shot. \n\nI dont know enough about how Cricket works to tell you if Rusty is a god at Cricket or if every other Bluey character is dogshit at Cricket. Someone else needs to do that research. \nAgain, obviously, Rusty loses in a death battle. Rusty is only notable if the challenge is a game of Cricket. And even then he may just be a big fish in a small pond. \n\nAlso fairies debatably exist in the world of bluey but to my knowledge we only ever saw the one in a scene from an episode that seems to be almost entirely from Bingo\'s subjective imaginative point of view. Meaning the fairy may have actually been like. a cool bug or something, despite the framing of the scene seeming like the fairy we see is seperate from the imagination game. \nAnyways power-scale the fairy to a cool bug capable of setting up a line of dominos.

Leaf Green and Fire Red took it from an feeling and looking like an OG Gameboy game to a being a full-fledged GBA game. Heart Gold/Soul Silver took GBA games and nearly doubled the content with the DS's improved storage space. With BDSP, they did update the graphics significantly, but they took the best part of the game (Pokemon Contests), removed the effects of and contest typings of moves, replaced the crowd-pleasing feature with a very simplistic rhythm game, and completely got rid of any reason to ever use poffins (I beat the Beauty, Coolness, Cuteness, Cleverness, and Toughness contests all with the same Pokemon--my  Gastrodon--who didn't do any special training and for who I didn't bother teaching new moves to). The contests no longer have any strategy. Pokemon Contests were supposed to be a seperate path for Pokemon who don't like/aren't good at combat. It's the reason I was excited for BDSP!

[3288, 2, 'Souls games arnt about reaction time, they’re rhythm games. You’re memorizing *when* to press the dodge button, it’s not about how fast can the player react. Most boss moves are highly telegraphed and are designed so that after you get familiar with their moves you can see them well in advance. I personally believe anyone can beat a souls game with enough practice. Obviously different people will learn at different rates, and previous souls game experience effects that. but in my personal experience I’ve watched multiple people who where objectively trash at souls games become better throughout their first play through, when they finally finish and decide to restart, the game is easy because they’ve already memorized the timings for all the bosses. My first run through of ds3 took like 70 hours, which is NOT short. My second run through took 10 hours, and my third took 5. I have completed that game 7 times now and it poses no challenge, but with elden ring I’m still on my first play through. Everything is new and I’m getting shit on. That’s just the way the game goes.\n\nElden ring also really increases the accessibility for new comers to the franchise imo because if you get stuck on a boss you can just explore in a different direction for awhile, and acquire a bunch of items and levels. You might find that when you come back to the boss you were stuck on that the new weapons you found or all the extra levels you got made the boss just that little bit easier to finally beat them.\n\nAnd worse come to worse, all souls games have multiplayer so if you have a friend who is willing, you can team up for harder bosses. And even though the boss gets a huge health boost for each additional player, being able to switch the bosses Agro can take the pressure off long enough for even the most fragile characters to survive that little bit longer to defeat the boss.\n\n\n\nFighting games genuinely do have that problem because reaction time is way more important when you’re fighting a human player, who is unpredictable, and often the moves are much much faster.\nSo I absolutely agree that anyone who has a bad reaction time will probably enjoy the game less.\n\nBut yeah contrary to popular belief dark souls is in fact not the definition of bad game design, it’s just a guitar hero wearing the skin of Skyrim', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1166110439793504418']

My approach was one of "I want to understand why you think the way that you do". My goal is never to agree with my enemy, or bolster my friends simply because I agree or don\'t agree, but approach every interaction as best I can from a testing and weighing of what they are saying and then understand *why* they are saying it. 9/10 I\'ve found that by simply quietly listening without agreeing, you can find where they actually get their ideas from.

In how he expresses his thoughts, he can come off as abrasive, but that\'s not really here or there. When you listen to them talk about religion early on before they re-constructed, and during the sex podcasts, there\'s a real emphasis on the church and what they believed. Looking at it critically, they say themselves that their view of God and Christianity was purely a works-based system of religion based on fear and doing the right thing because doing the wrong thing would "give you hell points" (I can\'t remember if it was that exact wording, but I think it was Link who said it in the sex podcast). What they have put out shows me that they had put their faith in the Bible Belt rather than Jesus.

Their life is defined by the system rather than the truth and pain found in scripture.

[8068, 2, 'I have mixed feelings on this. (but also for context idk how Genshin\'s specific monetization works) I agree that it\'s infantilizing to just say people have no self control. And it should be an obvious fact that every game with monetization (which is almost all of them now, because it works well for making money) will try to psychologically guide people to spend more.\nBut there\'s definitely a line that can be crossed where a game (or other business) is super predatory in how they try to incentivize you to give them money. Payday and title loans are super fucking predatory on people who don\'t have much money, and I wish they were illegal. Even though their customers are voluntarily participating in it, they\'re so misled and forced to overpay that it\'s just not a fair system. I don\'t agree with a hyperlibertarian stance that would say "well, you signed it, so it\'s 100% your fault and the company has no part in being shitty here".\nIf a large number of people are maxing out credit cards to play a game, it\'s a good sign that the game has crossed that line between decent monetization and tricking people into paying you too much. On the other hand, a few people who can afford it paying a lot, or the occasional person with an overspending problem going overboard, doesn\'t necessarily show predatory behavior IMO. Some other things in life also have a line that is sometimes crossed, like gambling. They toe a fine line between things like putting gambling problem help lines out there, and making gambling more addictive, and not taking credit cards for payment because it encourages overspending/debt, and not advertising to minors or allowing them to play as they\'re especially vulnerable.

[12696, 2, 'While I love the concept of the "Cube Rule" of food identification, I have a few major issues with the terms chosen by the OP.\n\n1) While quiche is all well and good, this category would serve the culinary world much better by calling that shape a pie. A quiche is just an egg pie. You can have a fruit pie, meat pie, dessert pie, etc. Pies can have a thin layer on top without them converting to the category I will complain about next.\n\n2) Instead of calzone, which is really just a pizza (toast) folded over onto itself, we should call this either ravioli or a dumpling. Dumplings are more widely recognized and used in many more cultures; however, some people might argue that a dumpling with no filling (e.g. gnocchi) should not count for this category. To such people, I point to toast, which does not require any topping to be toast.\n\n3) This is my most grievous complaint. Only about a third of sushi has the shape OP labeled as sushi. Makizushi is a type of sushi made by rolling ingredients with a seaweed wrapper, but it\'s neither the most common nor the most famous type of sushi. It\'s just the one commonly used to convince people to try sushi for the first time (i.e. California Rolls). Nigiri is the most common and popular type of sushi. Nigiri is toast. The category labeled "sushi" by the OP should instead, I propose and insist, be called burrito. Makizushi is just a sushi burrito that\'s been cut into slices. Same goes for pinwheel sandwiches.

[13906, 2, 'I think like all new things, awareness of mental health is something that is exploding in popularity right now. I think as society continues on the popularity will level out and we\'ll be able to address mental health easier and more effectively. Like I know it\'s a meme, but knowing is literally half the battle. As someone who has a disability and a few other issues, does it obfuscate me getting actual help and resources because of the oversaturation. I think the other issue though is the one that\'s old as time and why I don\'t think this is really a problem:\nPeople are always trying to find meaning, acceptance, and belonging. Knowing yourself, gaming, work culture, mental health, religion, LGBTQ+ spaces, MAGA, social justice, college, highschool, and even this discord are all spaces and groups with people in them (wow so thoughtful). Each group however, has things that tie them together. Ideally the things that tie these groups together are good and healthy but there are awful people out there who make it unhealthy. Don\'t misunderstand me, all of those spaces and shared experiences in each group are not equal and I\'m not making a value judgment or even saying they\'re equivalent. Bottom line, we as humans, want to belong. Society tells us to be "normal" but when we can\'t handle it we ask the question "whats wrong with me?" That shouldn\'t be why we ask the question, but it is why we ask it (or it\'s asked for us by our caregivers and friends early and later in life).

He always tells himself what he does is for love, even if he\'s being selfish. It doesnt hold up against Gideon, who shares some similarites with scott, but is more forceful and diabolical about \'having\' Ramona.\n\nafter his death, scott realizes how unhealthy that mindset is and he fights gideon with the power of self-respect, meaning he is now seeing himself as his own complete person, and this allows him to see the girls he dates as fellow people rather than prizes. (if i remember correctly, he doesnt apologize to knives and ramona until AFTER he achieves self-respect)\n\nSo you are kind of correct in saying the climax of Scott\'s arc is "the power of self respect > the power of love”, but the way that informs how he treats others is vital to his development and the theme of the movie.

[5133, 3, "Great question. I'll take a shot at (mostly the second half of) it here.\n\nToxic masculinity is when those negative/harmful behaviors are because of gender-enforced conditioning--be it parental nurture or cultural expectations. One popular example of this is the notion that men cat-calling women is positive. Many guys who cat-call think the women they target should be grateful to them for doing so. This is similar to how Trump infamously said that famous men can simply kiss women without asking and grope them. He claimed that women let famous people do that and asserted that they like it.\n\nA far more relatable example is when adults (men or women) tell boys that they're not allowed to cry yet allow girls to cry without scolding them. This enforces aspects of toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity neither allows men to express their emotions nor to seek help. Toxic masculinity says that men must be self-reliant, must be the provider in a relationship, etc. There are still people who look down on men that can cook/clean because those are women's jobs. Male chauvinism is always toxic masculinity, but toxic masculinity isn't always male chauvinism.\n\nLikewise, toxic femininity would be telling women that they can't work a job and aren't fulfilling their sacred duty as women unless they bear/rear a child. It's also telling a woman that she must dress a certain way or do certain things to please and serve her husband.", 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1077042516991418509']

You say it\'s "divisive" and that some people don\'t agree with the concept, but that\'s very confusing to me.

It\'s a taught behavior/mindset.\n\nThe opposite of that is nontoxic masculinity. Masculinity that is still strong, but for the sake of protecting others instead of projecting on them.

And I would argue more overtly so. The restrictions of women were almost always framed as reverent, almost worshipful.\n\nThe expressed issue with this for women is a lack of willingness to see an individual woman as an individual who may not be able to or even want to fully embody the cultural ideal of devine femininity. Fair.\n\nWhat our culture has not been made as explicitly aware of is that in this same system, men are no less objects. No less tied to their role of masculinity. \n\nI challenge you to find a man who's father died or left before he was 20 who did not have someone tell him that he was the man of the house now, that it was his responsibility to take care of the women in his home.

You can have issue with their previous beliefs or how they represent that now, but being a Christian itself is, in my opinion, absolutely a self-assigned label that will invariably include people/beliefs you don't like.\n\n2. Every Christian's interpretation of the Bible is heavily influenced by the culture that tells them how to interpret the Bible. You may think that your interpretation is better, but faith leaders in their tradition think theirs is. I don't see how either of you can show you're objectively more correct.\n\n3. Saying that deconstruction *has to* result in the same outcome as what theirs did is clearly false, I agree with you there. To give them the benefit of the doubt, it may be that they didn't see any other choice once they started asking the questions. It's true to some large extent that you don't choose your beliefs, I can't *choose* to actually believe something for five minutes just to prove it to myself. I could imagine it's true or act like it's true, and eventually that may likely convince me it's true, but I cannot consciously decide my beliefs.

[11436, 3, '“[Hitler] was wholly ignorant of any formal understanding of the principles of economics. For him, as he stated to the industrialists, economics was of secondary importance, entirely subordinated to politics. His crude social-Darwinism dictated his approach to the economy, as it did his entire political “world-view.” Since struggle among nations would be decisive for future survival, Germany’s economy had to be subordinated to the preparation, then carrying out, of this struggle. This meant that liberal ideas of economic competition had to be replaced by the subjection of the economy to the dictates of the national interest. Similarly, any “socialist” ideas in the Nazi programme had to follow the same dictates. Hitler was never a socialist. But although he upheld private property, individual entrepreneurship, and economic competition, and disapproved of trade unions and workers’ interference in the freedom of owners and managers to run their concerns, the state, not the market, would determine the shape of economic development. Capitalism was, therefore, left in place. But in operation it was turned into an adjunct of the state.”\n- Ian Kershaw, Historian', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/936876615777001472']

[5412, 5, 'So. A couple things. \n1. This is literally whataboutism. Buying something (not even a specific product. Just anything) from Amazon is not remotely comparable to buying one specific game.\n2. I wasn’t making an ethical argument. Nat was. I specifically said “IDK about that BUT I think it reflects poorly on your character.” In an objective sense, will Amazon cause just as much harm with ur money as jk Rowling? Probably. But. Boycotting a mega corporation that owns more brands than any of us could name is a much greater *sacrifice* than *not* buying hogwarts legacy  (which is mediocre at best and harmful and problematic in multiple ways on top of that). I’m arguing from Pathos, not Ethos. I’m saying that passing on this one game shouldn’t be a big deal. And if it is a bigger deal to someone than the harm, then that reflects poorly on their character. \n3. Yeah you’re right. Don’t buy from Amazon. Even when I talk about liking prime streaming shows I probably didn’t legally purchase the subscriptions and u shouldn’t either. Fuck Amazon. \n4. Tim is right actually. If an action is difficult to avoid it does have an effect on how guilty someone is for doing it. Shopping at a Whole Foods bc it’s got better groceries than anywhere else in town is morally less bad than buying a Harry Potter game. Like you have to buy food somewhere? Amazon needs to be better regulated. Harry Potter should be ignored. Different fights have different solutions. The Good Place is right that viewing morality an objective one size fits all way is ultimately kinda short sighted and outdated.\n5. I linked that Jessie Gender video bc I think she explains this a lot better than I can. I don’t think you should buy Harry Potter game. You can if you want to. But if you do so knowing the problems with it then you shouldn’t call yourself an ally to or an advocate for trans or Jewish people. Not buying this game is kinda the bare minimum in that fight. On the other side, As ive kinda argued before, I don’t think fully avoiding every mega-corp is an effective means of combating the evils of capitalism. The bare minimum is just advocating for better legislation. Bc you can’t fully avoid bad mega corps in todays society if you apply that consistently and “not buying” doesn’t even actively hurt them.

They're just doing it to troll social media. It's the same reason that Chick-fil-A had a record year when we boycotted it.\n(2) It's been non-stop the #1 game on Twitch because people want to see what the controversy is about AND (3) because streamers are refusing to stream during Twitch's Hogwarts Legacy ad campaign, which means that the only people streaming are streaming Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nFinally, (4) with HP specifically, it's so popular in Asia and other places where people don't speak English that the boycott only had the potential to marginally decrease sales. Of course, it had the opposite effect instead.\n\nBoycotts of large, established entities don't work in our contrarian society.\n\nMy follow-up lukewarm (in comparison) take: If we just quietly didn't buy the game, it wouldn't have done near as well. Everyone who cares about Trans people knows JK Rowling is a Transphobe. Telling people to boycott helps 0 people decide to boycott with you. They already weren't going to buy it.

They may have thought he\'d be harmless and sit on his butt or clown around without actually taking action (while fearing that Clinton would have actually abused power and caused harm). Trump was indeed terrible and horrible, but that doesn\'t reflect on voters.\n\nInstead, it\'s best to say "people who worship Trump are hurting the soul of our nation."
