Most people weren't mad that features weren't added; they were mad because features were entirely REMOVED.\n\nWith all previous remakes, the remake was the definitive version. Leaf Green and Fire Red took it from an feeling and looking like an OG Gameboy game to a being a full-fledged GBA game. Heart Gold/Soul Silver took GBA games and nearly doubled the content with the DS's improved storage space. With BDSP, they did update the graphics significantly, but they took the best part of the game (Pokemon Contests), removed the effects of and contest typings of moves, replaced the crowd-pleasing feature with a very simplistic rhythm game, and completely got rid of any reason to ever use poffins (I beat the Beauty, Coolness, Cuteness, Cleverness, and Toughness contests all with the same Pokemon--my  Gastrodon--who didn't do any special training and for who I didn't bother teaching new moves to). The contests no longer have any strategy. Pokemon Contests were supposed to be a seperate path for Pokemon who don't like/aren't good at combat. It's the reason I was excited for BDSP!

[5133, 1, "Great question. I'll take a shot at (mostly the second half of) it here.\n\nToxic masculinity is when those negative/harmful behaviors are because of gender-enforced conditioning--be it parental nurture or cultural expectations. One popular example of this is the notion that men cat-calling women is positive. Many guys who cat-call think the women they target should be grateful to them for doing so. This is similar to how Trump infamously said that famous men can simply kiss women without asking and grope them. He claimed that women let famous people do that and asserted that they like it.\n\nA far more relatable example is when adults (men or women) tell boys that they're not allowed to cry yet allow girls to cry without scolding them. This enforces aspects of toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity neither allows men to express their emotions nor to seek help. Toxic masculinity says that men must be self-reliant, must be the provider in a relationship, etc. There are still people who look down on men that can cook/clean because those are women's jobs. Male chauvinism is always toxic masculinity, but toxic masculinity isn't always male chauvinism.\n\nLikewise, toxic femininity would be telling women that they can't work a job and aren't fulfilling their sacred duty as women unless they bear/rear a child.

Just anything) from Amazon is not remotely comparable to buying one specific game.\n2. I wasn’t making an ethical argument. Nat was. I specifically said “IDK about that BUT I think it reflects poorly on your character.” In an objective sense, will Amazon cause just as much harm with ur money as jk Rowling? Probably. But. Boycotting a mega corporation that owns more brands than any of us could name is a much greater *sacrifice* than *not* buying hogwarts legacy  (which is mediocre at best and harmful and problematic in multiple ways on top of that). I’m arguing from Pathos, not Ethos. I’m saying that passing on this one game shouldn’t be a big deal. And if it is a bigger deal to someone than the harm, then that reflects poorly on their character. \n3. Yeah you’re right. Don’t buy from Amazon.
