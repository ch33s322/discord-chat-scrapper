Let people react to add a role that gives them access to the channel. People who are annoyed by it can just pretend it doesn't exist. Although, tbh, people can already mute it... there are many channels on every server I'm in that are permanently muted.\n\n3.

[1409, 2, 'Definitions *are* relative. Language constantly changes, degrades and morphs as it is passed from individual to individual. We can do a lot to learn and understand what other people mean, but universally correct definitions are impossible. For thousands of years, countless people have believed the division of languages to  literally be a curse from God to further divide us from Himself. To attempt to create universally true perfect definitions and categories is, in my view, to erect your own Tower of Babel. People will always use words in ways that feel comfortable to them, rather than how Webster decides they should be described. We see reality through a darkened glass of our own perception and all categories of words, “door”, “wheel”, “sandwich”, “vegetable” “chair”, “woman”, will always have weird edge case uses and exceptions no matter what parameters we set.', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/1233470384792272946']
