[11697, 4, 'Any social construct that cannot survive being deconstructed, deserves to be deconstructed.\n\nGender expression and gender roles are very much valid and useful within society and within relationships. *But* If our understanding of those concepts is never questioned, it leads to sexism, transphobia, bigotry, discrimination, and a lack of understanding of the concept of gender and a misuse of its role within society. \n\nI struggle to imagine a truly genderless society without some of these same failings. Lacking an element of self expression, and placing unfair physical and mental expectations on nonconforming people within that society. But these exact problems exist in our own society already and are the specific things that people critical of our understanding of gender as a concept seek to remedy. \n\nTherefore I think a partial deconstruction of the concept of gender is necessary and healthy', 'https://discord.com/channels/657566118285672469/804066380328599572/933182593728389130']
